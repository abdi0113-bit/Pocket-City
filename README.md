# Pocket City
This repository contains our grade 11 computer science culminating where we where told to create any kind of game we wanted, as long as it was in python. 

## How To Play

* Two or more players take turns filling their city with buildings that will each have their own unique effect

* At the start of each players turn they are given 10 coins which will allow them to either:
*       Buy buildings from the shop
*       Reroll the shop options
*       Expand the number of spaces on the grid

* If you want to buy a specific building, but you do not have enough money you can right-click to freeze. Freezing allows a building to appear in the next round's shop.

* The abilities of buildings can either come into effect when placed on the grid, before the active phase, or during the active phase.

* Each player starts off with 10 lives. During the active phase, the score of each player is compared with the median of all player scores. Any player whose score is below the median will lose a life. 

* Last player standing wins
