# Pocket City
This repository contains our grade 11 computer science culminating where we where told to create any kind of game we wanted, as long as it was in python. 

## How To Play

* Two or more players take turns filling their city with buildings that will each have their own unique effect

* At the start of each players turn they are given 10 coins which will allow them to either:
  * buy buildings from the shop
  * reroll the shop options
